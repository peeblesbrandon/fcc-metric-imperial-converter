The microservice leverages HelmetJS to prevent users from sniffing MIME type and prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, automated unit and functional tests have been implemented using Chai.

_This app was built according to [freeCodeCamp specifications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/metric-imperial-converter) as part of their Full-Stack Web Development curriculum._
